    <h1>Common Wi-Fi Authentication Issues</h1>
    <p>Users can encounter several problems when trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Below are some typical issues and explanations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Incorrect Password:</strong> Entering a wrong password is the most frequent cause of authentication failures. Double-check the password, including capitalization and special characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Compatibility:</strong> Some older devices may not support the encryption or frequency bands used by modern Wi-Fi routers.</li>
        <li><strong>Saved Credentials:</strong> Devices sometimes store outdated or corrupted network information. Removing the saved network and reconnecting can solve this problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Router Configuration:</strong> Settings such as MAC filtering or restricted IP ranges can prevent devices from authenticating properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Driver or Firmware Issues:</strong> Outdated or incompatible drivers on the client device or firmware on the router can cause authentication errors.</li>
    </ul>
